# Classification_Flow
This assignment encompasses a multitude of critical tasks in the realm of data analysis and machine learning such as:
Data preprocessing: Includes tasks such as data cleaning, handling missing values, feature scaling, and feature engineering to prepare the data for analysis.
Model building: Involves selecting an appropriate machine learning algorithm, fitting it to the preprocessed data, and optimizing its parameters to achieve the best performance.
Model evaluation: Entails assessing the performance of the trained model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.
Hyperparameter tuning: This crucial step involves optimizing the parameters of the chosen algorithm to improve its performance further. It focuses on fine-tuning parameters to achieve the best possible results while avoiding overfitting. This process enhances the model's generalization capability on unseen data.
